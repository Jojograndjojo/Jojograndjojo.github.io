            <p>When purchasing a lottery ticket there is around one chance in 14 millions of winning the jackpot. Even though I know that those odds are next to impossible, occasionally I pick numbers and do participate. There are two reasons to explain my irrational behaviour, firstly as slim are my chances of winning they still do exist. Secondly as long as I have not seen the lottery results, I get to be a potential Millionaire. As such I picture what my life should be like, it often follows the following: </p>

<p>1- Buy assets that will secure my newly acquired fortune. </p>

<p>2- Take care of my loved ones (not as in putting a contract over their head, but help them achieve their goals)</p>

<p>3- Go travel around the world and have  fun.</p>

<p>4-... And I guess doing something meaningful with my life.</p>

<p>That's right, even in my multi-millionaire fantasy I see myself working! I will not try to discuss  here the reasons why, as it would probably require years of psychoanalysis but I will point out what element I would want in a job, when money is not a necessity. <br>  
My ideal job would need to be interesting, intellectually challenging, fun and have an element of flexibility ( in the fantasy I am travelling around the world remember?). </p>

<p></p><p>Like many people that decided to change their career I realised that I could not find those elements in the job I had, so if what I was doing was not fun to me, or stimulating and I was not earning, a "winning the lottery" level salary, why would I keep doing that and what shall I do instead? I did a list of what was fun and stimulating to me in my current job and I realised that a lot of it involved, creating things, trying to implement ideas, data analysis and playing around with excel. I also remembered how much I enjoyed taking algorithm classes in university a few years back. After a bit of research I started to realise that Web development may be the answer. A field that offered a lot of jobs, something that seemed fun, creative, challenging and that could allow me to work virtually anywhere in the world, for any type of company. And even though it might not make a multi-millionaire out of me ( but who cares, I can still play the lottery) , something offering a very competitive salary. <br> <br>
The question then was, How could I become a developer?...</p>
