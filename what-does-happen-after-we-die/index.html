Seeing ourselves learning to take a first step, then a second one, and another one, to fall, to stand up again, take another step... <br>
Actually thinking about it, that movie would be long (I hope, very long and happy in my case) and probably very boring, I mean it already took me ages to describe myself learning how to walk. <br>
But I guess that being the afterlife and all, Ingmar Bergman, or Federico Fellini could edit the movie of my life, to only show the interesting parts. <br>
I like this idea but in case it doesn't happen, I will use this platform to tell the tale of my journey on the path to become a developer, which hopefully will bear some interest ( and maybe one will be adapted into a movie... you know in the afterlife)</p>
