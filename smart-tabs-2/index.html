            <p>During my time at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a>, I did participate in several projects and learnt a lot that way. <br>
Once the studying at Makers would be done, I thought that  I should keep doing projects and use them as a vector to keep my learning going. <br>
The project seemed secondary but then something happen.</p>

<p>If you happen to walk through Spitafields market in  London on a Friday, you might see this man playing the piano.</p>

<p><img src="../content/images/2016/08/spitafields_pianist.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Like I did, you might notice the tablet the pianist is reading music from. <br>
And like I did you may think "Wouldn't it be cool if the 'pages' were 'turning' as the music is playing, so the player could keep his fingers on the keys..." <br>
And like I did, you may also think "What if it tracked your progress, like guitar hero but for people who can actually play music" <br>
And like I did, you may also think "What about a composer mode ?" <br>
Well if you did actually think all of that, you have no personality, it's my idea get your own. <br>
Anyway it does seem like a technically challenging task to build an application that would do all of that, but still I will give it a shot</p>
