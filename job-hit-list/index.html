            <p>To get something I have to really want it, that's how it always seems to work for me and I guess it is fair. I want to get a developer  job and thanks Tim Berners-Lee, there are plenty of jobs around. However I do not want any job, I need to find the one(s) that I will really really want and if  I don't I will stay jobless... Again I do not get things that I do not really really want. <br>
But what would this(those) special(s) job(s) be?....</p>

<p>I decided to list and filter companies that hired junior developers by using an excel sheet, which I didn't find very user friendly. <br>
And then it hit me... <br>
I can code! Why don't I build an app that would match my requirements. <br>
Behold "Job hit list":</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/180764029">job-hit-list-mvp</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user56070124">Jonathan Passe</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>The idea is to keep a record and relevant information about cool companies and have the option of doing it collaboratively. <br>
I happen to know quite a few people that are looking for a dev job as well, but the type of jobs they want may differ from the type of jobs I want. Lets say I meet a person at a tech event, and they are looking for developers, it seems like a good company and an interesting job but still it does not feel like it would be for me. <br>
Well I can still add the details about the company and share the information with fellow coders (and they will owe me for life :-) ). <br>
The app is in its minimum viable product stage, I still need to add filters and make it look nicer, but I can (and do ) use it...</p>
