            <p>So I just graduated from MA. This is the point where I am meant to find a job. The course and living in London for 3 months with no income is obviously expensive. It would be tempting to jump at the first opportunity that presents itself right?</p>

<p>Well yes, but that will not be the course of action I decided to take, the truth is right now, I have very little idea about what kind of jobs are out there, even though there seem to be a lot of jobs available.</p>

<p>What I am planning to do over the next few weeks is meet as many professional as I can, not in the hope of finding a job (although if something cool presents itself, why not...), but to find out how different professionals are actually working what are they working on and see if it would something I would see myself doing.</p>

<p>I happened to go to the an agile Meetup in about an hour, which should be interesting as it is the way I would like to be working, I need to remember to ask the following questions :</p>

<ul>
<li>What kind of work do you do?</li>
<li>What does a week of work looks like?</li>
<li>How many people are in your team?</li>
<li>Do you use TDD ?</li>
<li>Do you have retros?</li>
<li>Do you use pair programming?</li>
<li>What kind of tasks your juniors do?</li>
</ul>

<p>I actually need to leave now if I don't want to be late, I shall edit that post in the future and update the questions if needed...</p>
